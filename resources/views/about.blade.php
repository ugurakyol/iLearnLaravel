    <h1>About Us</h1>

        When constructing your views, you're not limited to basic PHP.
        Instead, you can use Blade: Laravel's powerful templating engine.
        We'll talk about Blade more in the future, but for now,
        let's leverage it to create a layout file to reduce duplication and complexity.
